### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arthur, a Brazilian IT student and a software development enthusiast.

:brazil:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a software tester, my tests are mainly written using Cypress
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Django
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Python project

I started my studies in 2019, firstly learning C++. My main goal is to become a developer. I've been studying Python for more than a year, that's my "main" language so far. 

I feel ready to start working on software development, I'm currently looking for an oportunity to start.
