### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Arthur, a Brazilian IT student and a software development enthusiast.

:brazil:
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a software tester, my tests are mainly written using cypress.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS, Python, Django, Cypress and PHP.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Python project

I started my studies on 2019, firstly learning C++. My focus is Python and my main goal is become a Python developer. 

I've been studying Python for more than a year, that's my main language.
